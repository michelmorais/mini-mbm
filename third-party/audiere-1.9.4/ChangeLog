2017.12.05

  1.10.1 released.

  Restored the former build process: ./full-release.sh which now works on linux not just Cygwin (fixed the script as well as minor/dependent build scripts: bootstrap, build.sh, doxygen-dist.sh).

2017.12.03

  expertmm's fork started at https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere from https://github.com/vancegroup/Audiere
  
  tests/race/race.cpp: use cross-platform (conditionally implemented depending upon if defined _WIN32) best_sleep instead of windows.h and Sleep (otherwise prevents build of whole project)--based on <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1658386/sleep-function-in-c>
  
  SConstruct: added HAVE_SPEEX condition and if speex.h is missing, don't try to compile with it (otherwise missing speex.h [having a non-VC6 build environment] prevents build)--this determines whether to include src/speexfile/speexfile.cpp, src/input_speex.cpp.
  
  SConstruct: added use_winmm param for scons (always turned off if win32) that affects HAVE_WINMM (comment used to say "nothing checks for this" (now something does). Bug is fixed where was added to "source" variable even before check for HAVE_WINMM case added it again.
  
  moved license from doc/license.txt to LICENSE (so shows up on GitHub interface and is immediately visible)
  
  made changes suggested by autoconf:
  * add "AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([m4])" to configure.ac
  * add "ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4" to Makefile.am

  (2017-12-03) configure.in should be configure.ac nowadays, to avoid extension inconsistency and/or theoretical name collisions

  (2017-12-03) ensured that all audiere-svn (last updated 2011) changes were applied to this fork:
  * src/basic_source.h: changed (regression) `<string.h>` to `<string>`
  * src/debug.cpp: removed `"stdlib.h"` (already had `<cstdlib>` like svn 2011 does)

  (2017-12-03) implemented all patches from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/audiere>: these patches were made against the (very old) 1.9.4 unix source release, so changes were applied to this fork by hand (these AUR patches accepted into AUR by AUR audiere package maintainer allencch were created at unknown times between 2007-07-11 when AUR entry based on 1.9.4 release was created and 2015-06-09 when the audiere AUR package was last modified).
  
2014.09.23

  vancegroup's fork last commit uploaded (as of 2017) based on https://github.com/flibitijibibo/Audiere based on https://github.com/kg/Audiere based on ttp://tpreece.net/git/audiere.git (apparently based on svn version at original sourceforge project, since vancegroup's fork is nearly identical to it other than new features and is far different from last sourceforge release 1.9.4 from 2006). All changes logged on this date are at unknown dates between 2006.02.26 and 2014.09.23.

  The device name for DeviceFrame constructor was fudged to avoid string conversion errors (AUR patch fixes this, see 2017.12.03).
  
  HAVE_SDL and HAVE_PULSE conditions added to Makefile.am
  
  audiere.h, utility.cpp: checks for defined WIN32||_WIN32 replaced with _WIN32

  audiere.h: now does push and pop pragma warning if defined _MSC_VER, and set `#pragma warning(disable : 4786)`

  regression from string to string.h in basic_source.h (fixed, see 2017.12.03)

  debug.cpp: changed check for defined WIN32 to _WIN32

  debug.h: added `#include <cstdlib>` and changed
  ```
  #ifdef _MSC_VER
    #define ADR_ASSERT(condition, label) if (!(condition)) { __asm int 3 }
  ```
  to
  ```
  #ifdef _MSC_VER
    #include <intrin.h>
    #define ADR_ASSERT(condition, label) if (!(condition)) { __debugbreak(); }
  ```

  device.cpp:
  * make windows.h only included if defined _WIN32
  * add cases for: HAVE_WINMM, HAVE_DSOUND, HAVE_PULSE, HAVE_SDL
  * remove requirement that _MSC_VER not be defined for being able to use things other than directsound & winmm (affects the return value of `ADR_EXPORT(const char*) AdrGetSupportedAudioDevices()`)
  * added TRY_RECURSE and MAKE_DEVICE logic to replace broken NEED_SEMICOLON (and TRY_GROUP and TRY_DEVICE) logic
  * added (prioritized) check for the new sound systems mentioned earlier, in DoOpenDevice
  * added static_cast for ThreadedDevice
    
  device_ds.cpp, device_mixer.cpp, device_null.cpp, input.aiff, input_flac.cpp, input_mp3.cpp, input_speex.cpp, input_wav.cpp, loop_point_source.cpp, memory_file.cpp, resampler.cpp, sample_buffer.cpp, utility.h: parenthesis for `(std::max)` & `(std::min)` casts

  device_null.cpp: (type-o?) put extra scope braces starting on line after `ADR_GUARD...;` and ending on line before `AI_Sleep` 

  input.cpp, input_aiff.cpp, input_mp3.cpp, input_ogg.cpp, input_wav.cpp: changed `<string.h>` to `<string>`

  input_aiff.cpp: changed `#ifndef WORDS_BIGENDIAN` to `#if !defined (WORDS_BIGENDIAN) && !defined(__BIG_ENDIAN__)`

  input_ogg.cpp, input_wav.cpp: changed `#ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN` to `#if defined(WORDS_BIGENDIAN) || defined(__BIG_ENDIAN__)`

  input_flac.cpp, input_flac.h: changed `FLAC__StreamDecoderReadStatus FLACInputStream::read_callback`'s param `unsigned *bytes` to `size_t *bytes`

  mci_device.h: conditions for defined _M_X64

  utility.cpp: (regression) `#include <stdio.h>` (AUR patch fixes this missing include the right way, see 2017.12.03).

  utility.cpp: much more specific logic for AdrAtomic* including check for __GNUC__ and adding defines for `ADR_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED` and `ADR_USE_GCC_ATOMIC_INTRINSICS`

  configure.in:
  * `AC_ARG_ENABLE` for macsdl and sdl
  * added `LT_INIT`
  * added `AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_WXWINDOWS, false)`
  * added `AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_SDL, test "x$HAVE_SDL" = "xtrue")`
  * added `AC_CHECK_HEADER` for pulse/simple.h which affects new HAVE_PULSE define.

2006.02.26

  Added Lua bindings.  (Matt Campbell)

2006.02.13

  1.9.4 released.

  Modified full-release.sh to account for the change to two doxygen
  distributions.  (Matt Campbell)

  Removed erroneous "1.9.4 released." entry.  (Matt Campbell)

  Modified doxygen-dist.sh to put archives where full-release.sh expects
  to find them.  (Matt Campbell)

2006.02.12

  full-release.sh now exports CVSROOT.  (Matt Campbell)

  Added authors.txt to list of docs in vc6/dist.py.  (Matt Campbell)

  Fixed make-release-win32.sh to run scons instead of make under
  bindings/java.  (Matt Campbell)

  Changed hard-coded path to XPCOM root in bindings/xpcom/SConstruct.
  Now I suppose Chad won't be able to do the next release without changing
  it again.  (Matt Campbell)

  Replaced wxPlayer.rc with a much simpler version based on the MDI
  example in wxWidgets 2.6.  Dropped resource.h.  (Matt Campbell)

  wxPlayer is now linked with wxWidgets 2.6 in the VC6 build system.
  Fixed MDI parent frames to specify a size, since they otherwise end
  up with zero size on Win32.  (Matt Campbell)

  wxPlayer accessibility improvements:  Controls are always created
  in an order that's logical to the user, since (at least on Win32)
  the order of control creation determines the tabbing order.  Also,
  for controls with labels, the label is now created before the control.
  TODO:  Make tab traversal work in MDI child windows.  (Matt Campbell)

  Updated the file version number in src/audiere.rc.  (Matt Campbell)

  Modified bindings/python/setup.py so it only links with libstdc++
  on POSIX.  *Matt Campbell)

2005.04.21

  Modified DSAudioDevice::update so it doesn't hold the device's lock
  while sleeping.  As a result, streams and buffers open much faster when
  using DirectSound.  (Matt Campbell)

2004.11.30

  Added bindings to wxWidgets.  (Emanuel Dejanu)

2004.11.27

  Added VC7 build system.

  wxPlayer now compiles against unicode wxWidgets.  (Emanuel Dejanu)

  Split Doxygen documentation into one for users and one for developers.

2004.11.07

  Replaced mpegsound with a stand-alone version of the MPEG audio decoder
  from ffmpeg's libavcodec library. (Matt Campbell)

  Fixed a minor problem with seeking in DirectSound streams. (Matt
  Campbell)

2004.08.16

  Fixed a null pointer crash when loading an invalid MP3 file.

2004.07.29

  Added getRepeat() and setRepeat() on MIDIStream.

  MIDI seeking improvements.

2004.07.27

  MP3 seeking and framecounting fixes.  (Andrew Gatt)

2004.07.21

  Added MIDI support through the MCI subsystem on Win32 and Cygwin.
  (Chad Austin)

2004.07.06

  Added frame seeking support for MP3 files.  (Andrew Gatt)

2004.04.29

  Fix a bug in CondVar::wait that causes 100% CPU usage on posix
  systems.  (Richard Schaaf)

2004.04.09

  Moved callback system to be processed within another thread.  This
  allows you to delete the originating stream from the callback.

  Added support for CD audio support on Linux via libcdaudio.  (Chad Austin
  and Richard Schaaf)

2004.04.08

  Added callback system for stream stopped events.  (Richard Schaaf
  and Chad Austin)

  Made CDDevice methods use __stdcall on Windows.

  Added operator== and operator!= to RefPtr.  This could fix some
  potential bugs.

2004.04.05

  Added CD audio support through the CDDevice interface.  (Chad Austin
  and Richard Schaaf)

2004.02.02

  Fixed: Speex decoder never actually released its file handle.

2004.01.19

  Fix an mpegsound crash when loading corrupt MP3s (or text files).

  Use _beginthreadex instead of CreateThread.

  Added a button to see the format of streams and sounds in wxPlayer.

  Rewrote the Resampler class to use DUMB's cubic interpolation
  resampler.  (Matt Campbell)

2004.01.17

  Dramatically reduced the latency of the OSS device.  (Matt Campbell)

2004.01.12

  Added MP2 to the list of supported file types, since mpegsound can
  play them.

2004.01.10

  Added Speex support.

2003.11.08

  Fixed: Some MP3 files were returning incorrect sample format
  information, so they sounded wrong.

2003.09.24

  Added pitchshift to the Python bindings.  (Jason Chu)

2003.09.22

  Added support for reading metadata tags from Ogg Vorbis files.
  Interface designed with help from Brian Robb and Andy Friesen.

  Added ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 support.  (Original code written by Brian
  Robb.)

2003.09.04

  Opens MP3 files with ID3v2 tags with the MP3 decoder, not the MOD
  decoder.  The MOD decoder seems to be the most lenient, so it has
  been placed at the end of the autodetect list, behind MP3.

2003.07.17

  Made thread priority work when using pthreads.

2003.07.15

  1.9.3 released.

2003.07.01

  The configure script tries to link a small wxWindows application
  rather than trusting the existence of wx-config in order to find out
  if wxWindows exists.

  Made the FLAC decoder use libFLAC instead of libFLAC++.  This makes
  it easier to compile on platforms with differing C++ ABIs, such as
  IRIX (MIPSPro CC vs. GNU g++).

2003.06.29

  Removed the VC7 build system.  It's out of date, nobody uses it, and
  they could just open the VC6 one in VC7 anyway.

  Added support for custom loop points via the LoopPointSource interface.

2003.06.21

  SoundEffect objects in SINGLE mode no longer stream from the sample
  source.

2003.06.16

  Added AIFF support.

2003.06.15

  If a stream is set to repeat, then MOD loop points are honored.
  Otherwise, a MOD loop point causes the stream to stop.

  Added setRepeat() and getRepeat() to the SampleSource interface.
  This architecture change is required in order to support sample
  sources with non-standard looping functionality, such as loop points
  within MOD or AIFF files.

  Gave wxPlayer a crappy icon.  A better one would be welcome.  :)

2003.06.13

  Fixed some unaligned reads in the MP3 decoder code, which caused
  Audiere on SGI/IRIX to crash.

2003.06.12

  Replaced MikMod with an actively-maintained MOD decoding engine:
    DUMB (http://dumb.sf.net) Overall, the change is for the better,
    but there are a few important changes to be noted:
      - fixed a crash in certain Impulse Tracker files
      - mod looping now works correctly
      - some previously-unsupported effects now work
      - opening a mod stream now takes significantly longer, since
        DUMB builds up an internal seek table, which is currently
        unused
      - playing mod files now takes roughly five times more CPU time
        than it used to
      - DUMB works on big-endian architectures (such as MIPS (sgi) and
        PowerPC (mac)), where MikMod did not
      - DUMB tries to match the exact behavior of the "official"
        trackers (that is, Impulse Tracker, Scream Tracker 3, and Fast
        Tracker), so some mods that sounded fine in ModPlug Tracker or
        Winamp (MikMod) may sound strange.  For example, some of the
        Amstrocity remixes of Squaresoft songs have distortion caused
        by volume range clipping when played in DUMB.

2003.06.02

  Fixed some edge cases involving small sounds, DirectSound streams,
  and the repeating flag.

  Added min_buffer_length device parameter to DirectSound device to
  prevent static in very small sounds.

2003.06.01

  Fixed short bursts of periodic static while decoding MP3s.  it
  appears to be a result of the Visual C++ optimizer interacting with
  the MP3 decoder code.  (I can't claim that is an optimization bug
  yet...  there could be some invalid aliasing going on in the code.)

2003.05.30

  Fixed bug where resetting an MP3 input stream would emit a short
  burst of static.

  Fixed static between repeats in repeatable streams (thanks
  valgrind!)

  Fixed an exit crash on some systems by adding a CoUninitialize call
  to the DirectSound device destructor.

2003.05.27

  You can now specify what format you are loading for efficiency reasons.

2003.05.25

  Fixed a bug in the DirectSound streaming code where you would hear
  the beginning of some sounds before they actually stopped.

2003.04.22

  Added getName() method to AudioDevice.

2003.03.11

  You can now pass smart pointers straight into API calls, for example:
    AudioDevicePtr device = OpenDevice();
    OutputStreamPtr sound = OpenSound(device, "blah.wav");
    sound->play();

2003.02.17

  Added support for MemoryFile objects.

2003.01.27

  Removed support for OpenAL because it was causing compile issues on
  systems with different and incompatible versions of OpenAL.

2003.01.09

  No longer use the MTM or STM mikmod loaders because they crash on
  certain wav files.

2003.01.06

  1.9.2 Release

2003.01.05

  Many general improvements to wxPlayer.

2003.01.04

  1.9.1 release

2002.10.11

  added GetSupportedFileFormats for file format enumeration
  added audiere-config script which provides version information and
    external library dependencies
  finer synchronization granularity on DirectSound output streams for
    lower-latency OutputStream calls
  increase priority of Audiere update thread on all platforms but
    Win9x, which deadlocks
  switched from mp3blaster's mpegsound code to splay's mpegsound
  read 10 MP3 frames for smoother playback on corrupt (?) files
  added ClassPtr convenience typedefs so people can use them instead
    of RefPtr<Class>

2002.10.05

  the configure script outputs the URLs for required libraries if it can't
    find them

2002.10.04

  use the mpegsound library instead of mpglib because it sounds and
    works a lot better
  FLAC support, thanks to Jacky Chong and Chad  :)

2002.10.02

  added MP3 support again via mpglib (mpg123), thanks to Jacky Chong.
